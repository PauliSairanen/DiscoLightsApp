# DiscoLightsApp

* An iOS app that changes the background color in a different manner when different buttons are pressed
* The app has 3 buttons: 
<br> 1. for changing color smoothly over time
<br> 2. for changing color once
<br> 3. for changing colour rapidly over time (care if you have epilepsy)

# What I learned

* Using buttons to call functions
* Animation using UIView.animate
* Foreground and background threading
